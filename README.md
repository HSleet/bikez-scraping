# Motorcycle Web Scraping Project

Welcome to my web scraping project, inspired by my passion for motorcycles. This project is designed to gather comprehensive data about various motorcycle models using a single web crawler. The primary objective is to deepen my understanding of Scrapy and XPath selectors, two powerful tools for web scraping.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Web Scraping**: The web crawler, built with Scrapy, navigates through web pages to collect data about different motorcycle models. The code for this part can be found in the bikez directory.

2. **Data Cleaning and Analysis**: The second part of the project is encapsulated in the Jupyter notebook `motorcycles_data.ipynb`. This notebook is used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis. It helps to refine the raw data and remove unnecessary information.

For those interested in the raw, unprocessed data, it can be found in the `./bikez/data.json` file in the main project directory.

## Weekly Projects Program

This project is the first in a series of 52 projects that I have planned. The goal of this program is to undertake a new project or a part of a larger project every week. Each project will focus on different technologies that I'm interested in and want to learn more about.

Stay tuned for more exciting projects in the coming weeks!
